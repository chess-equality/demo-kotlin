## What is this?

This project holds standalone demonstrations of Source++ features available for Kotlin applications. These demonstrations are meant to
be used as a reference for how to use Source++ in your own projects.

## How to use?

Install the Source++ plugin via the JetBrains Marketplace by searching for: `Source++`.
Alternatively, you can download the Source++ plugin directly from [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12033-source-).

Once the plugin is installed, check out the demos below. Each demo contains instructions explaining how to use it.

## Demos

### [Tail Logs](./src/main/kotlin/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.kt)

This demonstration shows how to tail logs from a running application. Logs can be filtered by individual statements,
methods, and classes. The **Tail Logs** command works for any application that uses a logging framework that is supported by Source++.

For more information, see the Javadocs in the [Tail Logs](./src/main/kotlin/spp/demo/command/TailLogs.kt) class.
